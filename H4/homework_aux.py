#What is causing the non-determinism?

#The non-determinism is caused by the random initialization of the centroids. The algorithm will converge to a local minimum, which is why the results are different for different seeds.

#What is the best solution? Why?

#The best solution is the one with the highest silhouette score and purity score. The silhouette score is the average silhouette coefficient for all samples. The silhouette coefficient is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The purity score is a measure of how similar the clusters are to the classes. The best solution is the one with the highest silhouette score and purity score, which is the solution with seed 2.
